# il10

Designed by Doug Bantz and developed by Steven Stern for

Northshore Indivisible

This theme is available under the GPL for other Indivisble organizations.

There is only one "quirk" to the theme -- the front page displays the 3 most recent posts from the posts in categories 1 and 2.  If you're cloning
the theme, you can change this in the file `components/page/contents-front-page.php` at the function call to il0_fp_excerpts.

Posts support featured images, thought the featured image is not displayed in the single post template or the archive.  The featured image is used for the thumbnail on the home page. If a post does not have a featured image, the theme will use the featured image from a page titled "Default Featured Image".
